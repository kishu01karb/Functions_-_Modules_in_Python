# Assignment: Python Functions and Math Module Operations

This repository contains two Python programs that demonstrate the use of functions and the `math` module to perform basic mathematical computations.

---

## üî¢ Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

### üìå Description
This Python program:
- Defines a function named `factorial` that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.
- Takes a number as input from the user.
- Calls the function and prints the factorial of the number.

### üíª Sample Output
Enter a Number: 5
Factorial of 5 is: 120

## üßÆ Task 2: Perform Math Operations using `math` Module

### üìå Description
This Python program:
- Asks the user to input a number.
- Uses the Python `math` module to:
  - Calculate the square root of the number.
  - Calculate the natural logarithm (base e).
  - Calculate the sine of the number in radians.
- Displays all the calculated results.

### üíª Sample Output

Enter a number: 25
Square root: 5.0
Logarthm: 3.2188758248682006
Sine: -0.13235175009777303

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Make sure the input is a positive number, as `sqrt()` and `log()` functions from the `math` module require non-negative inputs.


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script using the following command:

```bash
python function_math_operations.py
